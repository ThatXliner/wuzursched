Wuzursched (pronounced [`/wʌzjɜskɛd/`](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=wʌzjɜskɛd), "wuzz-your-sked") is a website for sharing your schedules and viewing others, making comparing schedules a breeze.

## Current limitations

- Good/strict class normalization is a long-term goal.

## Development

Once you've `git clone`d and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.
