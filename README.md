Wuzursched (pronounced [`/wʌzjɜskɛd/`](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=wʌzjɜskɛd), "wuzz-yer-sked") kills the yearly ritual of screenshotting your schedule and squinting at everyone else's. Make a room, share the link, and instantly see which classes you have with which friends.

The whole site is designed to feel like the paper planner it replaces: ruled notebook paper, handwritten headings, sticky notes, and tape — with a chalkboard theme in dark mode.

## ✨ Features

- **🔗 Rooms are just links** — create a room in one click and share the URL. No sign-up, no email, no app.
- **⚡ Realtime everything** — schedules and classes appear the moment someone submits them, powered by Supabase Realtime.
- **🎯 Shared classes, highlighted** — every schedule in the room is compared against yours, and classes you have together light up.
- **🔍 Search & filter** — fuzzy-search students by name, or filter the room down to only schedules that overlap with yours.
- **🌗 Chalkboard mode** — dark mode swaps the paper for a dusty chalkboard, following your system preference automatically.
- **🧠 Remembers you** — your identity per room is stored locally, so you only enter your schedule once.

## 🏫 How it works

1. **Create a room.** You get a unique URL backed by a fresh room in the database.
2. **Enter your schedule.** Pick (or add) your classes for each period — A day and B day, four periods each.
3. **Share the link.** As friends fill in their schedules, they show up live, with your shared classes highlighted.

> [!NOTE]
> Wuzursched currently assumes an A/B block schedule with 4 periods per day. Good/strict class normalization (merging "AP Calc BC" and "Calculus BC") is a long-term goal.

## 🚀 Development

You'll need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 22+, and the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) (which needs Docker).

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ThatXliner/wuzursched
cd wuzursched

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Start a local Supabase stack and apply migrations + seed data
supabase start
supabase db reset

# 4. Generate a .env with the local Supabase credentials
supabase status --output env | node convert_env.js > .env

# 5. Run the dev server
pnpm run dev
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome! CI runs Playwright tests against a real local Supabase stack and verifies that the committed database types match the schema, so please run `pnpm run check` and `pnpm run lint` before opening a PR.
